I made an extension called #CCBE(Conscience Constellator's Browser Extension). It has many features I find useful. I made this vr for public distribution.
So far the only feature in public 1 is, it blocks #YouTube ads(maybe more sites in future), & 
features like, chrome storage, bookmark, & download, management, outside integration w/ #Constellatory, my web crawler, & other programs, & A custom icon that changes based on info like, whether page is bookmarked, 
are planned features.

In order to avoid YouTube's ad-block-block, it has to wait, 2 secs before skipping most ads, & 10 for those considered to be in the 1st ad session(delays are subject to change), 
& can't actually skip the-what I've dubbed-"ad end card" that player normally, sits, & waits, on after ad's done playing(which is perhaps intended to give user time to, click links, & stuff, after presentation)
, thus either user must click manually(still saves 3 secs or-as is the case w/ A certain elderly person, who can't be bothered to click "Skip"
, or someone w/ cooking ingredients on their hands-wait like 10 secs for it to be over, else risk elbow-sausage-fingering other keys).
Occasionally it still triggers ad-block-block, even though I spent lots of, time, pain, & suffering, to deal w/ that particular problem. When that happens I just reload.
It appears to B due to erroneously, not adding extra delay to 1st-session ad; reloading forcibly rearms 1st-session flag.
